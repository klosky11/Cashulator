# Cashulator

Welcome to Cashulator! This is a financial application based off of a group project in bootcamp that helps you keep track of your weekly income and spendings on your mobile device or desktop. First, you can enter your total income you have for the week in the Enter Amount input, click the Update Income button and your weekly income will be posted. Next, you can enter your expenses for the week using the options for Bills, Food, Clothing, Entertainment and Miscellaneous along with the amount for each and even more detail of the spending to stay organized. When the Add Expense button is clicked, each expense with its amount will be listed as well as added to the Total Summary pie chart, which is color coded to differentiate each category and help you see where your money is going. Each time an expense is added, it will automatically update your balance and will alert you once your balance is 0. This is a great way to know exactly how much money you have and what expenses are necessary before running over your budget!
